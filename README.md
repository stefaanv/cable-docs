# cable-docs 
Network cabling documentation
## Introduction
This project is intended as a exploration/tutorial of Nestjs.
The Nestjs documentation can be one-dimensional : the features are explained in isolation.  However real-life applications need to combine features which can be challenging in Nestjs.  For instance, you'll typically want all of your application to use configuration data, maybe even the code inside `main.ts` of in the **typeorm** configuration file.  Due to the way Nestjs is set up, this is a challenge.
